# ðŸ“Š SQL for Data Analysis â€“ Ecommerce Project  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project demonstrates the use of **SQL** for analyzing structured data from an **Ecommerce database**.  
It was built as part of my data analytics learning journey using **SQLite**.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
- Create and query a relational database  
- Use SQL commands like `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`  
- Perform **JOINS** (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)  
- Write **subqueries** for deeper analysis  
- Apply aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`)  
- Create **views** for simplified reporting  
- Optimize queries using **indexes**  

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset  
The dataset is a sample Ecommerce schema with the following tables:  
- **Customers** â†’ Customer details  
- **Products** â†’ Product catalog  
- **Orders** â†’ Order details  
- **OrderDetails** â†’ Line items with quantities and prices  

## ðŸ›  Tools Used  
- **SQLite** (Database engine)  
- **SQLiteStudio** (GUI for query execution)  

## ðŸ“Œ Steps Completed  
1. **Database & Table Creation**  
   - Created tables: `Customers`, `Products`, `Orders`, `OrderDetails`  
   - Inserted sample data to simulate transactions  

2. **Basic Queries**  
   - Select specific columns  
   - Filter rows with `WHERE`  
   - Sort data using `ORDER BY`  

3. **Intermediate Queries**  
   - Aggregate analysis with `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`  
   - Grouping results using `GROUP BY`  
   - Multi-table joins with `INNER JOIN`  

4. **Advanced Queries**  
   - Subqueries to extract insights  
   - Table aliases (`c.name`, `o.order_id`) for readability  
   - Customer spending analysis  
   - Top-selling products identification  

5. **Views & Indexes**  
   - Created views (e.g., `CustomerSpending`) for simplified reporting  
   - Added indexes for performance optimization  

## ðŸ“¸ Screenshots  
The repository contains **8 screenshots** showcasing the executed queries and their outputs.

## ðŸš€ Outcome  
- Learned how to design, query, and analyze relational databases  
- Gained practical experience with SQL commands, joins, subqueries, and optimizations  
- Built confidence in structured data analysis using SQL  

## âœ¨ Next Steps  
- Experiment with larger real-world datasets  
- Try advanced SQL in MySQL/PostgreSQL  
- Connect SQL with Python for end-to-end analytics
